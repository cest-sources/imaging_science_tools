Git is really helpful for keeping track of your research software.
But its also a huge tool an can be complicated:

We use this in our work group and its inevitable for working together.
We mostly use gitlab and github and some tools for windows that make life easier.
For a command line based intro look into:

and many other git tutorials.

We will focus in the follwing on gitlab and tortoisegit as a windows client.
Most things are similar on github and gitlab.

We choose gitlab over github as you can have unlimited private repositories (https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/01/07/github-offering-free-private-repos-for-up-to-three-collaborators/)
and also because FAU has a gitlab server (https://www.rrze.fau.de/serverdienste/infrastruktur/gitlab/).

But if you understand gitlab also github is easy to use.

Major usage:
1. git clone -  fresh code for a new group member with source control
2. git commit and git push and merge requests -  improvements of the code are stored back to the main source.
3. merge request and issues - traceability of code decisions - explanantion of a code decision and proof of improvement.
