But its also a huge tool an can be complicated:

We use this in our work group and its inevitable for working together.
We mostly use gitlab and github and some tools for windows that make life easier.
For a command line based intro look into:

and many other git tutorials.

We will focus in the following on gitlab and tortoisegit as a windows client.
Most things are similar on github and gitlab. So if you understand gitlab also github is easy to use.

Major usage:
1. git clone -  fresh code for a new group member with source control
2. git commit and git push and merge requests -  improvements of the code are stored back to the main source.
3. merge request and issues - traceability of code decisions - explanantion of a code decision and proof of improvement.
